This is a reduced testcase for an open question: why does the spec in `test.js` fail?

To try the testcase:

    npm test

You will get:

    Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: uiGmapGoogleMapApiProviderProvider <- uiGmapGoogleMapApiProvider

If you find the solution, please make a fork and publish your solution in a pull request. Thanks in advance.
