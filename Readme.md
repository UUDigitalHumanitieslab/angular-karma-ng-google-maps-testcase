This is a reduced testcase for a hereby resolved question: why did the spec in `test.js` fail?

To try the testcase:

    npm test

On the master branch, you will get:

    Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: uiGmapGoogleMapApiProviderProvider <- uiGmapGoogleMapApiProvider

It failed because providers can only be injected at configuration time, while `angular.mock.inject` is meant for run time. The solution in this branch uses a second module to capture the provider at configuration time.
